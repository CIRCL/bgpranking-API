BGP Ranking API
===============

BGP Ranking API is a simple set of Perl scripts to provide whois-like services to an existing BGP Ranking installation.

To run your own whois service, you'll need the following:

* A BGP Ranking installation (https://github.com/Rafiot/bgp-ranking)
* An additional Redis server for caching computed values
